# Applied AI for Materials

This repository is a collection of notebooks and other materials used for the "Applied Artificial Intelligence for Materials Science and Engineering" course at The University of Chicago. It is very much a work in progress, so expect large changes in content and organization in the next few months.

## Using this Repository

I have broken subject areas into different directories each with their own notebooks, lecture notes and Python environment. They will generally be arranged as having multiple subfolders that focus on a specific topic. 

## Course Outline

The course is broken out in to the following molecules (all of which are TBD):

- Effectively using Python for data science: Working quickly and reproducibly with Anaconda and Jupyter 
  - Topics: Managing Python environments PyData Stack, Jupyter Notebooks
- The Materials Data Ecosystem: Infrastructure for finding, using and sharing data
  - Topics: Databases, laboratory information systems, image publication
- [Molecular property prediction](./molecular-property-prediction): How physics, chemistry and machine learning fit together
  - Topics: Kernel and graph methods, chemoinformatics
- Supervised learning for inorganics: The importance of microstructure, composition and processing 
  - Topics: Representations for inorganic materials, coping with processing varation
- Generative methods for materials: Augmenting human creativity with AI
  - Topics: Generative Adversarial Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Autoencoders
- Bayesian parameter estimation: Greater certainty in using physics-based models
  - Topics: UQ for CALPHAD, model selection, learning from noisy data
